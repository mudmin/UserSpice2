All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project was originally based on Version 2.0.2 of UserCake (usercake.com), which was released in 2012.

- Adjusted some CSS (inline) in the header.  

### [2.5.4] - 2015-12-01
### Changed
- Removed the old reCAPTCHA 1.x and upgraded to version 2. This feature was originally planned for UserSpice 3.0, but it works better so I retrofitted it. 


### [2.5.3] - 2015-12-01
### Changed
- Turned the top login form to dynamic login/logout/sign up/account info buttons to reduce risk of brute forcing.

### Changed
- Created dummy reCAPTCHA keys that need to be changed on install
- Integrated reCAPTCHA into the registration form
- Integrated reCAPTCHA into the primary login form
- Added a nag on login and register pages for people using the default reCAPTCHA keys
- NOTE: reCAPTCHA work was made much easier thanks to a rewritten guide by opendna over at usercake.com
