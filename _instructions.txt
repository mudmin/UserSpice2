***What's Included
UserSpice is designed to be the basis of your next PHP/HTML project.  It's designed using Bootstrap and other
relatively universal web tools. 

For your convenience, we've also included a /blank_pages folder with an easy to use template for the site with
	and without a sidebar.
	
Additionally, we've included some bootstrap html files under /blank_pages/special_blanks that can give you some
	bootstrap inspiration and serve as templates
	
Where possible, we have maintained the original file structure and file names from the original UserCake project.





***Upgrading from UserCake 2.x or earlier version of UserSpice 2.x
This assumes you have a working install of UserCake or UserSpice.

1. Decide if you want to use your existing index.php file or the one included with this archive. If you don't need
the included index.php, remove or rename it.

2. Backup any existing files on your site, especially if you have modified them. This install will not touch your database.

3. Copy all the files from this archive and overwrite your existing files.

4. Use as normal! Visit http://userspice.com if you have any issues.



***Installing UserSpice from Scratch.
This option is primarily for developmental purposes.  You are probably better off waiting for version 3.x due before Christmas 2015.

1. Extract the archive to your computer

2. Create a database on your server or web host

3. Open the file models/db-settings.php and fill out your database connection settings. 

4. Open the file models/recaptcha.config.php and enter your reCAPTCHA site and private keys. If you don't have them, they can be 
obtained at https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin

NOTE: If you choose to use the default keys, they will work for a short time for testing purposes, but you will receive a nag in the footer
and these keys can/will stop working at any time. Don't be lazy. Get your own keys!

5. To use the installer visit http://yourdomain.com/install/ in your browser. UserSpice will attempt to build the database for you. After completion
   delete the install folder.
   
6. visit http://yourdomain.com and create a new user immediately as it will be your default administrator.

7. Be sure to login and go to Admin Configuration and set your Website Name, and Especially Website URL and Email so everything will work properly.
