Located in this folder are files that are recommended, but not required.  
They are meant to be in the root folder of your site but were not put 
there during installation because we did not want to overwrite any 
important files. Copy them one by one. Use them all or use none of 
them. It's up to you. Many of these files are designed to make your
site more responsive or to set policies for the site. It's all standard
bootstrap stuff.
